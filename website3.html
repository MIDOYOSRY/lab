                            The interior of the car
                        </h3><br>
                        <p>The interior of the new BMW M4 CS sets out squarely to create a sporting ambience. Lightweight M sports seats trimmed in leather/Alcantara get the ball rolling and the dynamic flavour extends all the way to the door panel trim made from compacted natural fibres and featuring pull loops. The bonnet – with its characteristic air outlet rearwards of the powerdome – and roof are made from the lightweight, extremely rigid and high-tech material carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP). The generous use of leather and Alcantara allows the M4 CS to create a compelling and well-resolved ambience brimming with sporting intent and undeniable class. No M4 CS driver will need to compromise on the nicer things in life. Indeed, among the standard features on board is automatic climate control, a version of the BMW Hi-Fi system Professional adapted to the signature acoustic demands of the M4 CS and the Navigation system Professional.</p><br>

                            <p>True to form, the BMW M designers have given the new M4 CS looks that reflect the car’s sporting intent. The signature feature of its prominent front end, complete with cutting-edge twin LED headlights, is the front apron with large three-section air intakes. These serve up an ample supply of cooling air to both the high-performance engine and the fade-resistant M compound brakes with four-piston callipers at the front and two-piston callipers at the rear. The new model-specific front splitter was made from exposed carbon fibre exclusively for the M4 CS special edition. In the interests of aerodynamic efficiency, it teams up with the rear diffuser carried over for the BMW M4 GTS and the likewise newly designed, exposed carbon-fibre Gurney spoiler lip on the boot lid to minimise dynamic lift. Innovative rear lights with OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) technology was introduced by BMW M exclusively for the M4 CS and M4 GTS, while the front splitter, Gurney and rear diffuser, together with the long CFRP bonnet, flowing, coupe-like roofline, elegantly sporty M exterior mirrors and muscular wheel arches allow the new BMW M4 CS to cut an extremely dynamic figure, even when it’s standing still!</p><br>

            <p>Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik was founded in 1910 by Gustav Otto in Bavaria. The firm was reorganized on 7 March 1916 into Bayerische Flugzeugwerke AG. This company was then renamed to Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. However, the name BMW dates back to 1913, when the original company to use the name was founded by Karl Rapp (initially as Rapp Motorenwerke GmbH). The name and Rapp Motorenwerke's engine-production assets were transferred to Bayerische Flugzeugwerke in 1922, who adopted the name the same year. BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa, designed in the spring of 1917 by engineer Max Friz. Following the end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R 32 in 1923.</p>
